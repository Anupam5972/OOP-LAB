In this C++ program we are counting the number of words, lines and the total size of a text file in bytes. I have used a text file “story.txt”. Make sure you already created this file and have some text in it. Place this file in the same directory where your source code file is present. I have used proper comments in the program to make it easy to understand. If you are still facing any problem then you can ask your questions in comment section.
